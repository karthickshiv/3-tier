Challenge #1

# 3-tier

Hello Team,

here i have attached the sample 3-tier architecture diagram hosted on GCP. I did on draw.io and converted to JPEG format , Im sorry about the picture view which couldnt get in a right texture. I just tried my best to draw it.

Challenge #2

Since last one year i have been working on GCP project i found code to get the metadata of an instance in JSON format. I tested on my test server.

Challenge #3

To be honest on the coding side do not have much exposure.
